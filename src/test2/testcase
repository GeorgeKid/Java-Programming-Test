Basically, I think it is not a code test case, so I will use text to describe the test cases.

test case 1: for function 1
input: create one LUN
output: one LUN

test case 2: for function 1
input: create multiple LUN's
output: multiple LUN's

test case 3: for function 2
input: expand LUN
output: LUN has been expanded 

test case 4: for function 3
input: export a LUN to a host
output: the host has received the LUN

test case 5: for function 4
input: un-export a LUN;
output: the host has released the LUN

test case 6: for function 5
input: remove an un-exported LUN
output: the un-exported LUN has been removed

test case 7: for function 6
input: retrieve a LUN
output: the information of the LUN

test case 8: for function 7
input: 2 or more requests 
output: all the requests are completed correctly

test case 9: for function 8
input:create 100 LUN's, export 50 of them
output: the performance of the system is not impacted 

test case 9: for function 8
input:create 1000 LUN's, export 500 of them
output: the performance of the system is not impacted 

test case 9: for function 8
input:create 10000 LUN's, export 5000 of them
output: the performance of the system is not impacted
